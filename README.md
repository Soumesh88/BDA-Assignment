## ðŸ§  Project Outcomes

### 1. ðŸ”¬ Research Prototype for Large-Scale Stock Trend Forecasting

This project demonstrates a robust and scalable pipeline for collecting, storing, processing, and modeling stock market data. The architecture integrates:

- **Data Sources:** Yahoo Finance, Reddit, Twitter (social and financial sentiment)
- **Storage Solutions:** 
  - **MongoDB (NoSQL)** for raw and unstructured data
  - **HDFS (Hadoop)** for large-scale structured historical stock data
- **Processing Engine:** Apache Spark used for PCA-based dimensionality reduction and parallelized ML workflows
- **Model Evaluation:** Comparative analysis between multiple regressors to find the best-fit predictive model
- **Visualization Tool:** Dash for interactive data visualization

### 2. ðŸ¤– Benchmarking Machine Learning Models vs. Traditional Statistical Methods

We evaluated and compared several ML and statistical models using RMSE and RÂ² scores:

| Model                   | RMSE     | RÂ² Score |
|------------------------|----------|----------|
| Isotonic Regression     | 105.1083 | -0.00042 |
| Decision Tree Regression| 10.4699  | 0.9901   |
| Gradient Boosting       | 9.3671   | 0.9921   |
| Linear Regression       | 5.8395   | 0.9969   |

**ðŸ“Œ Insight:**  
Linear Regression outperformed all models on RMSE and RÂ² metrics, proving effective for time-series trend forecasting in this context.

### 3. ðŸ“Š Interactive Tool/Plugin for Stock Market Analytics

An interactive frontend dashboard was built using **Dash** (by Plotly), allowing users to:

- Select stocks to visualize historical and predicted trends
- View model performance comparison dynamically
- Analyze features using principal component analysis (PCA)
